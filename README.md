# Analyzing NYC High School Data
## Introduction
New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair. 

A significant amount of data has been published, concerning student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. The datasets are the following:

* [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
* [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt) - Attendance information for each school in New York City
* [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information on class size for each school
* [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
* [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a) - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
* [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j) - Demographic information for each school
* [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8) - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

## Scope 

This project reads a number of different datasets (see above), combines them into a single one, clean pandas dataframe and further processes it, aiming to investigate potential relationships between demographics and SAT scores.

## Outcomes 

* North districts are characerized by higher safety scores. Specifically, the Upper Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens have on average higher safety scores, in contrast to Brooklyn.

* There is suspicion the SAT Scores to distribute "unevenly" among the races, with the "white" and "yellow" students to "enjoy" higher scores.

* The higher the number of students in a High School that take at least on AP exam, does not necessarily mean that this school will note higher SAT scores.
